/*This module is made to control I/O and volume on MoIP systems controlled by B-900-MOIP-4K-CTRL. Enjoy!

IMORTANT:
This module requires that the MoIP Controller be set up with a static IP. The choice is yours, but after either statically assigning the 
    IP address on the MoIP Controller or making an IP reservation on your router, use the IP-SET action button to save your MoIP Controller's IP address in your module. Once set, you can remove the action button from your setup. If you configure your MoIP Controller to use DHCP without setting a reservation on your router, the MoIP Controller will likely change its IP upon renewing a DHCP lease, and thus your Companion module instance will not be able to communicate with it.
